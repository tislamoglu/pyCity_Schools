w4 City Schools Challange

Few lessons learned from the data analysis are listed below:
 1) Chater schools have better test results then district schools
 2) Large schools (2000-5000) have worse test results than both small (<1000) and medium (1000-2000) size schools while the small and medium schools have very comparable test results
 3) Spending per student has a positive correlation with average test scores where the higher spendings result in higher test scores
